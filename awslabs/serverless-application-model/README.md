# AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)

The goal of AWS SAM is to define a standard application model for serverless
applications.

This GitHub project is the starting point for AWS SAM, and contains general
information, information about the model, and examples of common applications.

## Current version

**The current version is available
at [AWS SAM 2016-10-31](versions/2016-10-31.md).**

This repository contains the existing model as well as proposals for the next
version.

## Structure

Each section should contain folders named per version to avoid confusion between
the versions.

## Usage and Examples
Checkout the [How-To Guide](HOWTO.md) and [examples folder](examples/) for 
detailed instructions on how to write AWS SAM templates and deploy them 
to AWS CloudFormation
