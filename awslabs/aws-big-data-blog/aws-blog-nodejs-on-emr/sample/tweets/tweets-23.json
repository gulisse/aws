Many Americans lack the simple foundation needed to be considered what’s financially literate and the cycle continues down to their children and so on. \nHere are some highlights from The sixth annual Financial Literacy Survey of adults, conducted in 2012 on behalf of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Network Branded Card Association: \n•     Two in five U.S. adults gave themselves a C,D, or F on their knowledge of personal finance.\n•     56% admit that they do not have a budget.\n•     One-third, or more than 77 million Americans, do not pay all of their bills on time.\n•     39% carry credit card debt from month to month.\n•     Two in five adults indicated that they are now saving less than they were a year ago and 39% do not have any non-retirement savings.\n•     78% of adults who use prepaid cards for everyday transactions say they use them because they are convenient.\n•     74% use prepaid cards because they feel the cards are safer than carrying cash.\n•     72% utilize prepaid cards because it allows them not to overspend or spend money they don’t have.\n•     56% find that the cards enable them to better manage their money. \n\nI can personally attest to the 56% of young Americans that lack any budget or financial planning. Financial planning can be a difficult thing to do when you have no idea that you should be doing it. By simply devising a weekly schedule for yourself and expenses you can cut down unnecessary spending and begin to set financial goals. Many college age students also fall into the notorious credit card traps. There is no time better than college to build your credit score however it takes much diligence to keep up with your payment plan and spending limits; which can prove to be difficult to even those who have money to spend. \nMany of these bad spending habits can be traced back to the childhoods of those who never grew up planning. For example… \nDoughMain’s 2012 survey of Parents revealed that:\n\n•     81% of parents feel it is their responsibility to teach their kids about money and savings.\n•     63% of kids 18 and under have savings accounts, and 73% of those savings accounts were started before the age of three.\n•     43% of parents review bank statements with their kids monthly.\n•     51% of parents give their children allowance, but only 4% require them to deposit that money into a bank account.\n•     Only 28% of children have used online banking to view their savings account balance.\n•     Only 38% of parents are matching their children’s savings.\n•     Only 30% of children give some of their savings regularly to charity.\n•     For children without savings accounts, their money is most frequently saved in a piggy bank, bonds/CDs, or checking accounts.  \n\nFinancial planning is a crucial part of childhood that often goes neglected and leads to the negative percentages shown.  Budgeting and saving are often the most difficult pieces of the puzzle but are necessary components when structuring a successful future.","source":"web","type":"status"},"interaction":{"schema":{"version":3},"type":"facebook","id":4,"created_at":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 15:49:13 +0000","author":{"name":"Brother Voodoo ","id":0,"link":"http://twitter.com/brothervoodoo","avatar":"http://a0.twimg.com/profile_images/538164654/image_normal.jpg","username":"Brothervoodoo"},"content":"The number one objective of the Financial Literacy Initiative here at Clark Atlanta University is to empower our students with the ability to make sound financial decisions while laying a solid foundation for their future finances.
