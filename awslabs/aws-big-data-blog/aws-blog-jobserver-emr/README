This project is for using JobServer with EMR
- it provides BA's for installing JobServer and a simple project for benchmarking
- this is to supplement a big data blogpost - Installing and Running JobServer for Apache Spark on Amazon EMR
    -- the post goes into detail all the steps necessary to set up 


This project also supports the big data blogpost - Serving Real-Time Machine Learning Predictions on Amazon EMR
 - see under the <project>/ml_commands/README
	
	
You MUST be familiar with JobServer

         -- full_install_jobserver_BA.sh - the BA if you need to compile and install the JobServer distro - it copies a version back to S3 (change the variables at the header of the file)
         -- existing_build_jobserver_BA.sh - the BA if you have already built the JobServer distro and staged it on S3 (change the variables at the header of the file)
 - <project>/commands/*
         -- commands-cluster.txt - sample commands of creating the cluster with AWS CLI
         -- commands-flights.txt - sample commands of how to run the jar as a job on ERM/Spark (benchmark) and also how to interact with JobServer via CURL
 - <project>/jobserver_configs/*
         -- emr_contexts.conf  - context definitions for this project on JobServer
         -- emr_v1.6.1.sh    - configruation for JobServer
